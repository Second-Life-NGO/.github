🛰️ AI Drone Tech for Environmental Waste Detection
Second Life NGO | Technical Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the AI & Drone Department of Second Life NGO — a mission-driven initiative harnessing drone technology and computer vision to identify, classify, and combat environmental waste across the Mediterranean, Balkans, and North Africa.

🌍 Project Mission
We aim to build an end-to-end, AI-driven system that:

Uses drones to capture aerial imagery of coastlines, urban zones, and rivers

Applies computer vision models to detect plastic waste and illegal dumping

Generates geo-tagged environmental insights to inform cleanup efforts and policy

🔧 Core Components
Data Collection: Drone images from targeted zones

Labeling Pipeline: Manual and semi-automated image annotation using tools like Roboflow/CVAT

Model Development: Object detection (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, etc.) and classification models

Inference Engine: Real-time waste recognition from drone footage

Mapping & Reporting: Geo-spatial visualization of waste density by location

Deployment: Web interface (Gradio/Streamlit/Hugging Face Spaces) for partner NGOs and municipalities
