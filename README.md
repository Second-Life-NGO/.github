# üõ∞Ô∏è AI Drone Tech for Environmental Waste Detection

**Second Life NGO | Technical Overview**

Welcome to the official repository for the **AI & Drone Department** of **Second Life NGO** ‚Äî a mission-driven initiative harnessing drone technology and computer vision to identify, classify, and combat environmental waste across the Mediterranean, Balkans, and North Africa.

---

## üåç Project Mission

We aim to build an end-to-end, AI-driven system that:

- Uses **drones to capture aerial imagery** of coastlines, urban zones, and rivers  
- Applies **computer vision models** to detect plastic waste and illegal dumping  
- Generates **geo-tagged environmental insights** to inform cleanup efforts and policy  

---

## üîß Core Components

- **Data Collection:** Drone images from targeted zones  
- **Labeling Pipeline:** Manual and semi-automated image annotation using tools like Roboflow or CVAT  
- **Model Development:** Object detection (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, etc.) and classification models  
- **Inference Engine:** Real-time waste recognition from drone footage  
- **Mapping & Reporting:** Geo-spatial visualization of waste density by location  
- **Deployment:** Web interface (Gradio/Streamlit/Hugging Face Spaces) for partner NGOs and municipalities
